{"title": "SpurTalk", "description": "SpurTalk is a personal project management app for procrastinators.\nThe app is super cheerleading, non-judgmental, encouraging, and empathetic.\nAnother key features it that it is able to look into a project, identify the tasks, and break down a task into very simple actions. At the maximum level of simplification, an action would take only a minute or two to complete. Eg, open your book and read the first line of the lesson. Or put on your running shoes for 2mn, then you can remove them.\nThe app has to be able to communicate with the user in many ways including notifications, emails, whatsapp messages, snapchat, etc.\n", "instructions": "", "color": "#0077b6", "memory": "own", "file_structure": {"enabled": true, "max_depth": 5, "max_files": 20, "max_folders": 20, "max_lines": 250, "gitignore": "# A0 project meta folder\n.a0proj/\n\n# Python environments & cache\nvenv/\n**/__pycache__/\n\n# Node.js dependencies\n**/node_modules/\n**/.npm/\n\n# Version control metadata\n**/.git/\n"}}
