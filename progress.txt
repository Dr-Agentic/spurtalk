Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/current
- Implemented user authentication with NextAuth.js v5 using Google, GitHub, and Email providers
- Added PrismaAdapter integration for user account storage in PostgreSQL
- Created protected API endpoint /api/user/profile for retrieving user profile
- Added frontend ProfilePage to display timezone and preferences
- Files changed: src/authOptions.ts, src/pages/api/user/profile.ts, src/pages/profile.tsx
- Learned: Need to ensure proper type safety with NextAuth session, and to manage Prisma client lifecycle
- Gotcha: Existing TypeScript errors in task breakdown API need to be resolved for build to succeed
