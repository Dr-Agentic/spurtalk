Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Task Breakdown Assistant (US-001)
- Created AI-powered task breakdown that automatically breaks down overwhelming tasks into 5-10 tiny, non-threatening steps

- Implemented state management with localStorage persistence
- Created AI simulation logic for task decomposition
- All acceptance criteria met: input form, suggested steps, small achievable steps, accept/reject/modify functionality, saved breakdowns
- Code successfully builds and runs in development server
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase uses React with TypeScript and Vite for build tooling
  - State management is handled with React hooks and localStorage
  - AI functionality is simulated with pattern matching for different task types
  - Files are organized with src/ containing components/, hooks/, types/, and utils/
  - JSX styles are used for component styling

## Sat Jan 10 2026 - US-005
- Implemented Procrastination Pattern Insights (US-005)
- Added procrastination pattern tracking for time of day, task type, and emotional state
- Created ProcrastinationInsights component with weekly insight reports
- Implemented pattern analysis and actionable suggestions
- Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in procrastinationInsights utility
- Updated PRD to mark US-005 as completed
- Verified component works correctly in browser with proper integration
- All acceptance criteria met: pattern tracking, weekly reports, optimal timing suggestions, non-judgmental tone, TypeScript compilation

## Sat Jan 10 2026 - US-006
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Context Preservation (US-006)

- All acceptance criteria met: quick note field, auto-saves location, shows last session info, suggested next actions, timeline view, TypeScript compilation
- Component verified working correctly in browser at http://localhost:5173/
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Context preservation requires careful state management for work sessions and snapshots
  - Location data (window.location.href) provides useful context for resuming work
  - Timeline views are helpful for users to review their progress and context
  - Empty states should provide clear onboarding guidance for users
  - Context notes should be easily accessible and searchable by task

## Sun Jan 11 2026 - US-009
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented Emergency Deadline Mode (US-009)
- Created comprehensive emergency mode system for crisis situations
- Added one-click activation with both quick (2 hours) and custom deadline options
- Implemented rapid assessment algorithm that triages tasks by urgency and complexity
- Added essential task filtering to show only critical items with time-boxing
- Integrated existing 2-minute Pomodoro timer with enforced breaks
- Created post-crisis reflection system with learning prompts
- Added EmergencyDeadlineMode component with dual state management (calm and active)
- Updated useAppState hook with emergency mode functions and state
- All acceptance criteria met: one-click activation, rapid assessment, essential task display, time-boxing, reflection
- Code successfully builds, runs, and passes TypeScript compilation
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Emergency mode requires careful state management to preserve user context
  - Time-boxing should be flexible and configurable based on user needs
  - Reflection prompts are valuable for learning from crisis situations
  - Emergency UI should be visually distinct but not alarming
  - Task triage algorithms should prioritize by both urgency and user capacity
